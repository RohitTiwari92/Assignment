This assignment will enable you to automatically generate different types of slides. 
This folder contains 2 types of slides which need to be generated.




1) Players selected for team - state wise.
 
	This slide contains a fixed title, the states and players in each state. Both states and the players in each state are variable.
 The actual data for states and players should be read from a JSON configuration the structure for which needs to be decided.
 On changing this config, the slide data should change.

Things to take care of:
		
i) If the data is insufficient for 1 slide, new slides should automatically be created.
		done
ii) The font, coloring scheme for states should be read from the JSON and change accordingly.
done 



2) Companies crawler report by <Analyst Name>.
	This slide contains some sample data about markets and companies. 
The table headers are fixed, but the data can be variable. The data for all the fields should be fetched from a JSON configuration,
the structure for which needs to be decided. On changing this config, the slide data should change.
Also, the table formatting/color scheme should be configurable to allow similar tables to be easily created.
	
Things to take care of:
		
i) The analyst name in title is dynamic.
	done	
ii) If the data is insufficient for 1 slide, new slides should automatically be created.
	done	
iii) The font, coloring scheme for states should be read from the JSON and change accordingly.		done



Please state any other assumptions you are making.
